# PakUtil
Program for creating pak files. 

* Note this .pak format is not the same as ones used in unreal engine
* This format is good from combining a bunch of files togethers and compressing them like a zip
* These files can also be used to compile a dll and the paks can be used with games


To use as a library:
* Put all the source files in your project or compile as a dll
* You can then call the functions in the pak class to encode and decode pak files
